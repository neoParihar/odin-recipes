    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      “Marry Me Chicken” continues to reign supreme on the internet, and it’s
      easy to see why. The combination of creamy sauce, tender chicken, and
      bright sun-dried tomatoes creates a meal with tons of craveable flavor. It
      works as a casserole, a soup, and even when swapping in beans for the
      chicken. The next frontier? Chicken salad, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      It makes total sense to apply the “marry me” treatment to chicken salad—it
      already has a creamy element in the form of mayonnaise, so why not spike
      it with some salty Parm and fruity sun-dried tomatoes?
    </p>
    <p>
      The resulting umami-forward, tangy sauce binds shredded chicken together
      perfectly for adding to a sandwich or scooping up with crackers or butter
      lettuce. A little bit of minced shallot cuts through the richness, and a
      splash of sherry vinegar (optional, but highly recommended!) underlines
      the tang from the tomatoes.
