    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Ah bruschetta, one of the best ways to enjoy the bounty of summer.
      Pronounced "brusketta", this classic Italian appetizer is a perfect way to
      capture the flavors of garden-ripened tomatoes, fresh basil, garlic, and
      olive oil. Think of it as summer on toast!
    </p>
    <p>
      My friend Dee showed me how to make it years ago, and it couldn't be
      easier to prepare. It's just a mixture of chopped tomatoes, balsamic,
      basil, and garlic, spooned over olive-oil brushed slices of toasted
      baguette or rustic bread.

      It's perfect for a party because you can make a large batch of the topping
      ahead of time, as well as toasting baguette slices. Either bring out a
      bowl of the bruschetta topping for people to put on their own toasts, or
      do it for them right before serving.
